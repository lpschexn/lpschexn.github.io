I'm a PhD student at Michigan Tech with a research focus on energy-efficient lidar-based autonomous systems. I completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Computer engineering at [Michigan Tech](https://www.mtu.edu) and continue my work in the Robust Autonomous Systems Laboratory. When I'm not working, I like to read, hike, and I'm just getting into mountain biking!
